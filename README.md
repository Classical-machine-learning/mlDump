# README

This repository is for the 100 days of ML challenge in which I devote some time to ML every day and upload whatever I do.

EVERY CODE HAS BASIC THEORY BEFORE THE CODE.

Beginners can also use this as a reference as I will be starting from the basics of ML and moving on to differnt concepts as a means of me learning and revising as well as sharing what I have learnt.

Heres to ML!
