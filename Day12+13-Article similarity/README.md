These two days were focused on document similarity. This could easily be extended to a recommender system or as an added service. 

The repo for this is:

https://github.com/SubhadityaMukherjee/legalScore

Note: The system gives more bias to legal articles but any bias can be given by changing finaldict.txt and running the dictcreator() function in leg.py
